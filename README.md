##Important Plugin Integrations
It is mandatory to install and configure the following plugins:

1. Toolset WP Types: The theme is heavily integrated with that plugin, all the custom posts and taxonomies have been configured with this tool and there is a folder class/types/ that contains all the code about this integration, staring for TypesSettings.class.php that is the main manager class.

2. Gravity Forms: This plugin handles most of the interactions with the user. We use the "User Registration add-on" to implement the sign-up functionality. All the other forms are heavily integrated as weel, each of the Gravity Forms takes care of a very particular but important data imput from the user.

3. VC Comporser: This plugin is the reason for the platform being on wordpress, the idea is to create many components to help the content team create better courses. Components like: Replit Exercise, Quizz, Regex Parser, etc.
