# BreatheCode Theme

This is the sexiest developer starting theme for The WordPress CMS, it has all you need to start coding right away and feeling like a real developer, here are some of the perks:
- Bootstrap 3: Extend the [_tk parent theme](https://github.com/Themekraft/_tk) (one of the most recomended base themes).
- Using [Composer](https://wpackagist.org/) as package manager for everything (including plugins).
- Using the command line to install and manage wordpress ([WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/)).
- The perfect .gitignore to only upload the minimum files.
- Laravel Eloquent ORM [Eloquent ORM](https://github.com/tareq1988/wp-eloquent) for any database extend (use the WP_Query or any other WordPress function if your are working on your own tables).
- A few plugins already suggested on composer.json based on my experience.
- A lot of examples on how to do stuff inside your wordpress.

## More WordPress plugins?

From now on, you should only install plugins available in the WPackagist project, there are thousands of plugins and basicall all the professional plugins are available:
https://wpackagist.org/search

If your plugin is no available, you can still install your own plugins if you want and nothing will break (unless you install crapy plugins) :)
